1. Purpose

Distribute the ADIOS2 library; see https://csmd.ornl.gov/software/adios2

ADIOS 2: The Adaptable Input Output (I/O) System version 2  is an open-source
framework that addresses scientific data management challenges, e.g. scalable
parallel I/O, as we approach the exascale era in high-performance computing
(HPC). ADIOS 2 bindings are available in C++, C, Fortran, Python and can be
used on supercomputers, personal computers, and cloud systems running on
Linux, macOS and Windows. ADIOS 2 has out-of-the-box support for MPI and
serial environments.
